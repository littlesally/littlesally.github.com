It is hard to believe but it has been 5 days since we brought our Sally home, in these five days we had so many ups and downs…I don't even know where to begin. Today I wanted to, however, write about one or actually two remarkable things Sally did, both involving water.

Even though she had a short encounter with water during the weekend, when she dipped her paws at the Strand beach, today she swam for real. Maybe she wouldn’t have dared, but there was a duck and Sally with her natural curiosity just had to look at what this strange creature with a beak instead of a muzzle was. It was so exciting to see her swimming, see the instincts kick in. 

Just like a good morning shower for us people, a dip in the lake for a dog is refreshing the body and soul.  After this swim Sally was like on drugs, pulling the leash, jumping at people passing by, biting our shoes…oh god! What did we do in return? We gave her bath in our kitchen sink. She was a bit weirded out by it, coz it wasn’t on her terms. Nonetheless, with a ton of treats and praise she managed to get out of there as a clean dog. I couldn’t help thinking, she must be the cutest dog in this world!
