It's actually been more than a week since we've seen the puppy, but we were in Amsterdam this last weekend and the week before I was busy/lazy. We get to see the puppy again this weekend, which has been a frequent topic of conversation as of late.

Anyways, the puppies seem to be growing along nicely and now are developing rather distinct personalities. Of interest in that regard is the fact that our Sally seems to be the more devious and mischievous of the two. Tina has mentioned that she is rather fond of exploring the apartment in the middle of the night and is also rather vocal.

I would expect that this behavior is a development as the puppy gets older, though Beata seems concerned that we will soon have a certified troublemaker on our hands. That's rather reasonable to expect, actually, though I think that I'd prefer this over a puppy interested only in sleeping and eating. Personality is a good thing!

Of course, too much of a good thing can also be dangerous, and I expect that we'll have our hands full (in a good way) during July.
