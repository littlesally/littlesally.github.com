Last week Nik and I went shopping for puppy stuff in the pet store nearby our house. Yes, we were getting hyped before the scheduled puppy visit. We got some advice on how to pick a good puppy collar and leash. And we couldn’t go home without some other accessories, we picked a little blanket type of thing that we would want to have on a couch or a bed, if we want Sally to join us there.

Finally on Saturday we met Sally and her family again! She was bigger and perhaps even more adorable than before. The puppies don’t spend 24/7 with their mom anymore, they got teeth and Tequilla seemed quite relieved that someone (us) came to distract her at all times hungry puppies. 

I suspected that Sally was trying to impress us, showing us her good side. She was social and coming to us; she even licked and bit my fingers, yay! At the same time she showed the calm personality that we like in her mom and sister. The same couldn’t be said about her brother Easton, who was a bit of a handful, crawled all over the place and even voiced his disagreement. 

Nik and I will see her again in two weeks; she will be 6 weeks old then. 
Look at these eyes!
