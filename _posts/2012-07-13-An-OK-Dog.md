Today was a big first for Sally; it was her first day without an accident in the house. Perhaps I'm being optimistic, but I think that she's starting to get the idea of house training. Unfortunately for me, her "getting it" means me having to walk her up and down three flights of stairs to the downstairs backyard.

We joke that at the end of the day, Sally is an "ok dog". Not necessarily a "good dog" or "bad dog", but just "ok". This is because when one averages out her good and bad deeds over the course of a given day, the tend to even each other out. Usually the "bad" things are those actions which take us by surprise, such as her barking wildly at the neighbor's dog which she met the day before and got along with.

Actually, for such a young puppy, she's doing great. There are only a few problem areas which we've identified, namely her silly agression towards other dogs and separation anxiety. Both are to be expected from such a young dog, and I think that they are each getting better as time passes.
