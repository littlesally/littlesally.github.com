We've got a couple thousand kronor in Beata's piggybank, which was earned entirely by her walking other dogs in the neighborhood. Now we're finally starting to spend some of the cash, but it's been actually harder to do than we anticipated. Finding good dog toys is especially hard -- what's with all the squeaking crap?

Anyways, I'm sure that we don't have all the stuff we will need at first, but having the bed here without a dog to lie in it makes us wanting her here all the more. However, when the puppy decides that exploring the apartment at 4am is more fun than sleeping in the bed (as we've heard she is fond of doing), we might end up wondering why we rushed to get it.

Tina's last blog post seems to name Sally as the more relaxed but mischevious of the two pups. If it's true, I think she'll be a good match for us. If not, well, I'm sure we'll find a way to love her anyways.
