There will be exactly eight puppyless days in our lives. I can’t believe it!

Sally, the little “charm-troll” as they say in Sweden, totally wins me every time I see her. Last time she licked my face practically at the doorstep of Tina’s apartment (maybe I am sick, but I find it super cute) and this time she decided to take a nap in my arms. You can see here her tired puppy eyes when I had to wake her up for the little photo-shoot. It is clear which one of the two of us is more excited about this pic. 

As Tina said, we are now officially the owners and she is just “watching” the dog for us until Nik returns from the US.  I brought a little blanket and a stuffed toy with me. We had them at home for several weeks so that they would pick up our smells. Why is that? One day, when she ends up in our apartment, without her original family, she will find our smell a bit familiar; she might quicker feel like at home. 

Sally went through a very thorough vet check this week. They looked at pretty much everything on her, teeth, eyes, heart, lungs etc. She seems to be one healthy puppy, which makes us, of course, very happy. She is now registered with the Swedish Kennel Club and has a chip in case she gets lost. I also picked an insurance plan for her.

Now, the only thing left to is the countdown to her arrival.
