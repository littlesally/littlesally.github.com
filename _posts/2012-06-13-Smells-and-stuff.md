title: Smells and stuff

After a somewhat long quest, Beata chanced upon a great dog bed which she picked up the other day. I'm reminded of how pregnant couples get the baby's room decorated and ready in anticipation of the big day, and although the amount of work is much less our excitement is just as great.

It turns out that dog stuff, like many other things in this world, has no limit to how much money you can spend on it. We aren't cheap, but we also aren't going to spoil the dog with a bed more expensive than our own (which is definitely possible to do). I was quite happy when we found a nice bed which fit our requirements (washable cover, slight inner indentation) without having to spend an arm and a leg. Better yet, we found it used (but not abused), so we got a better deal and saved the environment a tiny bit.

My mother advised us that we should give to the breeder a few items with our smell on them before picking up the puppy. This way, she can get used to our smell and apartment from the comfort of our own home. Beata & I ended up at the exact same thought to put the dog's blanket and a few toys in our bed at night. Hopefully this won't be terribly uncomfortable and will make the puppy's first nights at home a bit less traumatic.
