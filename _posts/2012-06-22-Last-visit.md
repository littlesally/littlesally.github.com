Last weekend I visited Sally for the last time before she will (hopefully) move in with us. More on the "hopefully" in a bit. I'm headed to the US for two weeks this Sunday, but Beata is due to meet her again this week.

In the last few days, both Beata and I have been talking about how this has been our last solo weekend together, and when I come back from the US we'll already be three in this apartment. When I think about it like that, it all seems rather dramatic, but in truth I'm looking forward to the new routines and lifestyle that the dog will bring us.

During our last visit we brought some small treats in the hopes that it would endear Sally to us a bit more. Whether or she made a connection between the free food and us remains to be seen. However, she seemed to be very social and receptive to our presence, and also responded to her name and the "come" command. It was exciting to actually interact with her and see her moving around.

On a more serious note Easton fell sick this week with an unspecified stomach bug, though he seems to be doing better now. Sally was apparently unaffected, but Tina (the breeder) has also fallen sick, so we're just hoping that everyone can hang in there and get well soon!
