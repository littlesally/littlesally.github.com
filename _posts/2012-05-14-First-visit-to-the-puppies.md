title: First visit to the puppies

This weekend, Beata & I went to visit the puppies for the first time. They are
barely two weeks old, and have just started to open their eyes. To say that we
were smitten would be a bit of an understatement.

The puppies were both quite cute, as expected, and we got to hold them for a
bit. Though they could move, they couldn't exactly walk or get around on their
own. As they napped, their paws twitched and moved about.

We were also quite impressed with Tequila's mothering skills. She seemed to be
quite a capable and caring mother, and not at all worn out by the attention
needed by her pups. Aqua, on the other hand, seemed a bit put off by the
puppies, as if she didn't exactly know what to make of them or how to behave
around them. Given that I'm roughly the same way with human babies, I'll cut
her a bit of slack on that point.

We visited for about an hour and then gave the dogs a bit of time on their
own. In about two weeks we will try to visit again, and needless to say, both
of us are looking quite forward to this. By that time, the pups should already
be up and running about.
